        </div>

        <div>
            <p>There’s nothing like spotting the first sweet ripe strawberries of the season at your local farmer’s market.
                This year, the warm weather is slow coming in some parts of the country, and that means the strawberries
                might be still green. But the color shouldn’t stop you from buying them: tart green strawberries are all
                the rage. Chefs are using immature strawberries both fresh and pickled, in everything from salads to cakes.
                If you prefer your berries red and juicy, you’re probably in the majority. However you like them, we’re betting
                your strawberry knowledge didn’t run this deep — until now: </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Strawberries are the only fruit that wear their seeds on the outside. The average berry is adorned with some
                    200 of them. No wonder it only takes one bite to get seeds stuck in your teeth.</li>
                <li>Strawberries aren’t true berries, like blueberries or even grapes. Technically, a berry has its seeds on
                    the inside. And, to be über technical, each seed on a strawberry is considered by botanists to be its
                    own separate fruit. Whoa, meta!</li>
                <li>Strawberries are members of the rose family. Should you come upon a bush of them growing, you’ll see: they
                    smell as sweet as they taste.</li>
                <li>The strawberry plant is a perennial. This means if you plant one now, it will come back next year and the
                    following and the year after that. It may not bear fruit immediately, but once it does, it will remain
                    productive for about five years.</li>
            </ol>
