    <h1>About Dragons</h1>


    <p>A dragon is a legendary creature, typically scaled or fire-spewing and with serpentine, reptilian or avian traits, that
        features in the myths of many cultures around world. The two most well-known cultural traditions of dragon are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The European dragon, derived from European folk traditions and ultimately related to Balkans and Western Asian mythologies.
            Most are depicted as reptilian creatures with animal-level intelligence, and are uniquely six-limbed (four legs
            and a separate set of wings).</li>
        <li>The Chinese dragon, with counterparts in Japan (namely the Japanese dragon), Korea and other East Asian and South
            Asian countries.[1] Most are depicted as serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence, and are quadrupeds
            (four legs and wingless). </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The two traditions may have evolved separately, but have influenced each other to a certain extent, particularly with
        the cross-cultural contact of recent centuries. The English word dragon and Latin word draco derive from Greek δράκων
        (drákōn), "dragon, serpent of huge size, water-snake".[2] </p>
    <p>Despite the verbal similarity, the term "draconian" does not refer to Dragons, but to the Athenian law scribe Draco.</p>
